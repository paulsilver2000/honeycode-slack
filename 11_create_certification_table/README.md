# Creation of the Certification table 

This table will be used to hold the main components of a team member. 

To create the certification table, on your "My Drive" click on certifications and it will create a new table called "Table1".

Add the required columns, changing column1,2,3 and add the additional columns. 

Change the table to look like the following: 
|Current   |New value  |
|---|---|
|Table1    |certifications   |
|Column1   |Name   |
|Column2   |Manager   |
|Column3   |Practitioner   |

Add columns   
|---|
|PractDate|
|PractValue|
|ArchAss  |
|ArchAssDate|
|ArchAssValue|
|DevAss     |
|DevAssDate|
|DevAssValue|
|SysOpsAss   |
|SysOpsDate|
|SysOpsValue|
|Status |
|TotalCerts|

Your Table1 should now be called ```Certification``` table, and look like the image below:
